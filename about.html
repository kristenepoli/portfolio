<h2>About</h2>
<p>I'm Kristen Poli. I'm a product manager at <a href="http://www.contently.com">Contently</a> and the former Vice Chair of the Contently Foundation for Investigative Journalism (now called The Hatch Institute). 
I love creative writing and working on technical projects that benefit the creative community. My research on content strategy, search engine optimization, and social movements has been featured at Social Media Week, SimilarTalks, and at The University of Pennsylvania, where I earned a fellowship from CAMRA (Collective for Advancing Multimodal Research Arts). 
I enjoy teaching and have led classes and workshops at the University of Washington, Bloguettes, and The Society for Marketing Professional Services (SMPS).
